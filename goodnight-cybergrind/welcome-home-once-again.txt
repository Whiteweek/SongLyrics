Smithers says "Women and semen don't mix."
And Mr. Burns says "We all know what you think, Smithers."
And that was my favourite joke in The Simpsons
See, that's what they're doing a few hundred miles away
Across the Channel, across the Atlantic
Eating dinner and they're watching the fucking Simpsons!
They're sleeping in their beds next to their wives
But we're here, chained to a fucking radiator
Because the OC has gone insane!
Starting the world again when the rest of the fucking world hasn't even stopped
Just imagine, just think about it
How could infection cross the oceans?
How could it cross the mountains and the rivers?
It can be stopped!
Right now, TVs are playing and planes are flying in the sky
And the rest of the world is continuing as fucking normal!
Think! Actually think about it!
What would you do with a diseased little island?
They quarantined us
"There is no infection. It's just people killing people."
He's insane!
Time to go.
