i ran out of titles ONCE AGAIN! bruh???

clock in, coffee’s cold, yet the grind’s the same
another day on your generic 9/5
powerpoint dreams and excel sheets
i ran out of titles once again, bruh

friday’s here yet the calls won’t stop
another meeting that could’ve just been a fucking email
they want innovation, but they kill every spark
i ran out of titles once again, bruh
