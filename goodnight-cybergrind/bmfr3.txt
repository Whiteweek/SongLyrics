breakcore metal for retards 3

i'm lost in the haze of a fractured scream
echoes of silence; cut the neural network bullshit
shadows cling tight, i'm soaring upright
chasing the light as it drifts away from me
i will never say any meaningful words
i will keep screaming the insensible bullshit
banging against the wall every fucking day  
try and get away? yet i can't!

sharpening claws, thickening glows
anxiety grows, going down - i'm sick of it
fracturing maze in monochrome haze
no fucking ways of expressing how i hate myself
just a shitty phase of shitty fucking days
a blaze up my head overwhelming me with bullshit
of issues of life, pick up a knife
and shove it in my back, i'll ultrakill myself

sharpening claws, thickening glows
anxiety grows, going down - i'm sick of it
fracturing maze in monochrome haze
no fucking ways of expressing how i hate myself
just a shitty phase of shitty fucking days
a blaze up my head overwhelming me with bullshit
of issues of life, stop speaking to me
i'm screaming total bullshit that no one will understand
