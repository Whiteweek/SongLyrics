peak distraction mechanics

i won't bow down to your twisted game
i am standing tall and i'm never seeking fame
my words cut deep like a razor blade sword
you mess with me again and you'll wish you were never born

i don't care about your distaste
i've told you once; i don't wanna hear this anymore
i won't conform to fit your mold
and if i ever hear it once again, then i'm just gonna
cut your old flesh open, apart

my hate's uprooted like a fallen tree 
(shut the fuck up and) stay low 
it's done, slice away - today is gonna be a dead day!
i can't hurt you, i can't stand you
just put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
i can't let in again the force-fed life

i don't care about your distaste
i've told you once; i don't wanna hear this anymore
i won't conform to fit your mold
and if i ever hear it once again then start counting down your fucking days!
