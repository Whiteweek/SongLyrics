bbrreeaatthhee!!

infinite loops in a finite mind
paradox claws yet iâ€™m left behind
the sum of your dreams converges to zero
the limit of my sanity approaches the infinity

singularity undefined
nothing's changed, but these days entwined
breathe in the infinite, breathe out the distillate
come on jim, just fucking breathe
