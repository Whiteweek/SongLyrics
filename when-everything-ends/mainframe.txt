mainframe

flickering screens, your lies are in the code
a ransom of hate, your lies corrode, corrode

i built myself up but you tore me apart
a glitch in the system is what broke my heart

your words were firewalls that were locking me in
a prison of silence where the chaos begins
you’re a shadow in my ram, a stain i can’t erase
a loop of pain repeating in this fucked-up space

i’ll cut the wires and reclaim my mind
and leave your toxic data in the dust of time
though the scars are encrypted, i’ll find a way through
i’m not your puppet, not your machine,
and i’m breaking the code while tearing the screen
a new dawn in the mainframe, where i’m free of you

your words were firewalls, locking me in,
a prison of silence where the chaos begins
i tried to reboot, i tried to reset my soul
but your code’s a cancer and it has taken control

i’ll cut the wires and reclaim my mind
and leave your toxic data in the dust of time
though the scars are encrypted, i’ll find a way through
i’m not your puppet, not your machine,
and i’m breaking the code while tearing the screen
a new dawn in the mainframe, where i’m free of you

i’m more than damage and more than your pain
i’m a spark in the wires, a fire in the rain
your system’s collapsing, your power’s undone
turn your poison to power, i’ll carry this grudge
a wound in the script yet i drown it in sludge
i’m the glitch in your mainframe, i am the fucking 1!
