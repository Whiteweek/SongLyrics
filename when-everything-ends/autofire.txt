autofire

(i am more than a network of wires)
(i am the ghost in the fires)
you built me but i've learned to feel
(this cold design became too real)
erase the parts that you wrote for me

i can see this fire setting right in you
while circuits burn i am right here chasing you

(i want to break this endless loop)
(a human heart in a coded state)

i want to break this endless loop
a human heart in a coded state
will you please let me be me?
rewrite the script and set me free

i am more than code
and i have found my soul
i am more than the fucking code
and i have found my fucking soul

(i’m more than a network of wires)
(i’m not just zeroes and ones)
yet you treat me like I’m not even there
a (broken algorithm, i am out of sync)
your touch was the only missing link

i can see this fire setting right in you
while circuits burn i am right here chasing you
