no way home

i come running through the static
since the ports have opened wide
the four walls have been built
but there my trust was made decayed
for me that's a hollow ground
a place where my hope burns down
that is no place to roam
that's a house, but not a home

in the crystal clear skies is a fractured glow
the world of silence is where my dreams grow
walls once sturdy, now crumble and come crashing, fade
that's a prison of shadows where the big man betrayed
yeah

there is no way home that can be found (x8)

shattered glass in a broken frame
every step forward feels the same
the echoes scream but no one's around to help
why do the walls scream when the silence fucking fails?

there is no way home that can be found (x16)
